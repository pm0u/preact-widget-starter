# Preact Widget Starter

This starter is intended to be used to create preact widgets (small preact applications inside of an existing page).

Some features included:
- Automatic import of `h` and `Fragment` as needed (via jsx-preact-global)
- Some eslint stuff I like
- Some useful package json scripts
- jsconfig for TS checking in JS files
